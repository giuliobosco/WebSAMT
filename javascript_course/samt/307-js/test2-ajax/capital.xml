		<NAME>Damascus</NAME>
		<TOWN>Damascus (Arabic: دمشق‎‎ Dimashq [dɪˈmaʃq], Syrian: [dɪˈmɪʃeʔ]) is the capital and likely the largest city
			of Syria, following the decline in population of Aleppo due to the ongoing battle for the city. It is
			commonly known in Syria as ash-Sham (Arabic: الشام‎‎ ash-Shām) and nicknamed as the City of Jasmine (Arabic:
			مدينة الياسمين‎‎ Madīnat al-Yāsmīn). In addition to being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in
			the world, Damascus is a major cultural and religious centre of the Levant. The city has an estimated
			population of 1,711,000 as of 2009.

			Located in south-western Syria, Damascus is the centre of a large metropolitan area of 2.6 million people
			(2004). Geographically embedded on the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 kilometres
			(50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft) above sea
			level, Damascus experiences a semi-arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows
			through Damascus.

			First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from 661 to
			750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad. Damascus saw
			a political decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in the Ayyubid and
			Mamluk periods. Today, it is the seat of the central government and all of the government ministries.

		<ETYMOLOGY>The name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as T-m-ś-q in the 15th
			century BC. The etymology of the ancient name "T-m-ś-q" is uncertain, but it is suspected to be pre-Semitic.
			It is attested as Dimašqa in Akkadian, T-ms-ḳw in Egyptian, Dammaśq (דמשק) in Old Aramaic and Dammeśeq
			(דמשק) in Biblical Hebrew. The Akkadian spelling is found in the Amarna letters, from the 14th century BC...

		<NAME>Shanghai</NAME>
		<TOWN>Shanghai (Chinese: 上海; pinyin: Shànghǎi; Shanghainese: Zånhae IPA: [z̻ɑ̃ hᴇ]), often abbreviated as Hu
			(simplified Chinese: 沪; traditional Chinese: 滬; pinyin: Hù) or Shen (Chinese: 申; pinyin: Shēn), is one of
			the four direct-controlled municipalities of the People's Republic of China. It is the most populous city
			proper in the world, with a population of more than 24 million as of 2014.[9][10] It is a global financial
			centre and transport hub, with the world's busiest container port. Located in the Yangtze River Delta in
			East China, Shanghai sits on the south edge of the mouth of the Yangtze in the middle portion of the Chinese
			coast. The municipality borders the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the north, south and west, and is
			bounded to the east by the East China Sea.

			As a major administrative, shipping, and trading town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due
			to trade and recognition of its favourable port location and economic potential. The city was one of five
			treaty ports forced open to foreign trade following the British victory over China in the First Opium War.
			The subsequent 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1844 Treaty of Whampoa allowed the establishment of the Shanghai
			International Settlement and the French Concession. The city then flourished as a center of commerce between
			China and other parts of the world (predominantly Western countries), and became the primary financial hub
			of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. However, with the Communist Party takeover of the mainland in 1949,
			trade was limited to other socialist countries, and the city's global influence declined. In the 1990s, the
			economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in an intense re-development of the city, aiding the
			return of finance and foreign investment to the city.

			Shanghai has been described as the "showpiece" of the booming economy of mainland China; renowned for its
			Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings, such as those along The Bund, the City God Temple and the
			Yu Garden.

		<ETYMOLOGY>The two Chinese characters in the city's name are 上 (shàng, "above") and 海 (hǎi, "sea"), together
			meaning "Upon-the-Sea". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song Dynasty, at
			which time there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. There are disputes as
			to exactly how the name should be understood, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang
			dynasty Shanghai was literally on the sea...

		<NAME>Dubai</NAME>
		<TOWN>
			Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-by; Arabic: دبي‎‎ Dubayy, Gulf pronunciation: [dʊˈbɑj]) is the most populous city in
			the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital
			of the Emirate of Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the country. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the
			only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country's
			legislature. The city of Dubai is located on the emirate's northern coastline and heads up the
			Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area. Dubai is to host World Expo 2020.

			Dubai has emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major transport hub for
			passengers and cargo. By the 1960s, Dubai's economy was based on revenues from trade and, to a smaller
			extent, oil exploration concessions, but oil was not discovered until 1966. Oil revenue first started to
			flow in 1969. Dubai's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, but its reserves are
			limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.

			The emirate's Western-style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from
			tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Dubai was recently named the best destination for
			Muslim travellers by Salam Standard. Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative
			large construction projects and sports events. The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high-rise
			buildings, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Dubai has been criticised for human
			rights violations concerning the city's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce. Dubai's property market
			experienced a major deterioration in 2008–09 following the financial crisis of 2007–08, but the emirate's
			economy has made a return to growth, with a projected 2015 budget surplus.

			As of 2012, Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle
			East. In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world, after Geneva. Dubai
			was rated as one of the best places to live in the Middle East by U.S. global consulting firm Mercer.

		<ETYMOLOGY>Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word
			was used to describe the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba. Another theory states that the name came
			from a word meaning "money", as people from Dubai were commonly believed to be rich due to the thriving
			trading centre of the location...
