			'Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (About this sound listen)) is the capital and most populous city in France, with an administrative-limits ' +
			'area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles) and an official population of 2,206,488 (2015). The city is a commune and department, ' +
			'and the heart of the 12,012-square-kilometre (4,638-square-mile) Île-de-France region (colloquially known as the \'Paris Region\'), whose 2016' +
			' population of 12,142,802 represented roughly 18 percent of the population of France. Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe\'s ' +
			'major centres of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts. The Paris Region had a GDP of €681 billion (US$850 billion) in 2016, ' +
			'accounting for 31 percent of the GDP of France. According to official estimates, in 2013-14 the Paris Region had the third-highest GDP' +
			' in the world and the largest regional GDP in the EU.',
			
			'Tokyo (/ˈtoʊkioʊ/, Japanese: [toːkʲoː] (About this sound listen)), officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital city of Japan' +
			'and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of ' +
			'the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kantō region on the southeastern side of the main island ' +
			'Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government ' +
			'since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji ' +
			'moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was ' +
			'formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).',
			
			'Cairo (/ˈkaɪroʊ/ KYE-roh; Arabic: القاهرة‎ Al-Qāhirah, About this sound pronunciation (help·info)) is the capital city of Egypt.' +
			'The city\'s metropolitan area is the largest in the Middle East and the Arab world, and the 15th-largest in the world, ' +
			'and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its ' +
			'geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, modern Cairo was founded in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty, but the land ' +
			'composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. ' +
			'Cairo has long been a center of the region\'s political and cultural life, and is titled "the city of a thousand minarets" for ' +
			'its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo is considered a World City with a "Beta +" classification according to GaWC.',
			
			'Buenos Aires (/ˌbweɪnəs ˈɛəriːz/ or /-ˈaɪrɪs/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbwenos ˈaiɾes]) is the capital and most populous city ' +
			'of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent\'s ' +
			'southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the first one was the meaning intended ' +
			'by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre". ' +
			'The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most ' +
			'populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million.'

			'The name "Paris" is derived from its early inhabitants, the Celtic Parisii tribe. The city\'s name is not related to the ' +

			'\t\trole during the Age of Enlightenment, and more literally because Paris was one of the first European cities to adopt gas ' +
			'\t\tstreet lighting. In the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. Since the late ' +
			'\t\t19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.',
			
			'Egyptians often refer to Cairo as Maṣr (IPA: [mɑsˤɾ]; Egyptian Arabic: مَصر‎), the Egyptian Arabic name for Egypt itself, ' +
			'\t\temphasizing the city\'s importance for the country.',
			
			'Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), which means "estuary". Its name was changed to Tokyo ' +
			'\t\t(東京 Tōkyō, 東 tō "east", and 京 kyō "capital") when it became the imperial capital with the arrival of Emperor Meiji in 1868,' +
			'\t\tin line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city ' +
			'\t\t(like Kyoto-京都, Beijing-北京 and Nanjing-南京).',
			
			'It is recorded under the archives of Aragonese that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari (Sardinia) ' +
			'\t\tunder the Spanish Crown, after its capture from the Pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a ' +
			'\t\thill that overlooked the city. The hill was known to them as Buen Ayre (or Bonaria in Sardinian language), as it was ' +
			'\t\tfree of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland.'

		<p id="text">A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is
			distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular
			administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law.
			
			Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation.
			The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and businesses, sometimes
			benefiting both parties in the process, but it also presents challenges to managing urban growth.
			
			A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and exurbs. Such cities are usually associated with
			metropolitan areas and urban areas, creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for
			employment. Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or
			megalopolis. Damascus is arguably the oldest city in the world. In terms of population, the largest city
			proper is Shanghai, while the fastest-growing is Dubai.</p>
