Cairo

Cairo (/ˈkaɪroʊ/ KYE-roh; Arabic: القاهرة‎ Al-Qāhirah, About this sound pronunciation (help·info)) is the capital city of Egypt.
The city's metropolitan area is the largest in the Middle East and the Arab world, and the 15th-largest in the world, 
and is associated with ancient Egypt, as the famous Giza pyramid complex and the ancient city of Memphis are located in its 
geographical area. Located near the Nile Delta, modern Cairo was founded in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty, but the land 
composing the present-day city was the site of ancient national capitals whose remnants remain visible in parts of Old Cairo. 
Cairo has long been a center of the region's political and cultural life, and is titled "the city of a thousand minarets" for 
its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo is considered a World City with a "Beta +" classification according to GaWC.

and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of

Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government 
since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji 
moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was 
formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi).

of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's 
southeastern coast. "Buenos Aires" can be translated as "fair winds" or "good airs", but the first one was the meaning intended 
by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name "Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre". 
The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most 
populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million.

		free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city (the castle area), which is adjacent to swampland.

Etymology:	The name "Paris" is derived from its early inhabitants, the Celtic Parisii tribe. The city's name is not related to the 
		Paris of Greek mythology. Paris is often referred to as The City of Light (La Ville Lumière), both because of its leading 
		role during the Age of Enlightenment, and more literally because Paris was one of the first European cities to adopt gas 
		street lighting. In the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. Since the late 
		19th century, Paris has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.
